## Description

> <strong>Note on support:</strong> The purpose of the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/all-in-one-event-calendar) is to capture bugs, but we need to set the expectation that troubleshooting  issues can take up to one week or more, having a very small team (1 support person). Please read our [sticky](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/read-this-first-welcome-to-all-in-one-event-calendar-support-forum) post before creating a new support thread and [vote/raise ideas here](http://ideas.time.ly/).
> Please check-out our [Hub and Pro hosted plans](http://time.ly/products) for many extra features and prioritized support.

## Import and Export Events

Timely offers full ics/ical support. You can import events from other calendars and offer users the ability to subscribe to your calendar.

Importing and exporting iCalendar (.ics) feeds is one of the strongest features of the All-in-One Event Calendar system. Enter an event on one site and you can have it appear automatically in another website's calendar. You can even send events from a specific category or tag (or combination of categories and tags).
